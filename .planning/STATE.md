## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Auth must be Phase 1 -- proxy is currently open, security-critical
- [Roadmap]: Fleet monitoring before billing -- higher daily operational value
- [Roadmap]: Control room last -- composite view needs all component parts built first
- [Roadmap]: Data migration deferred to v2 -- RC APIs must be battle-tested first

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RC `/auth/admin-login` response format unknown -- need to verify if JWT or opaque token (affects Phase 1 implementation)
- Role-based access specifics (admin vs staff permissions) need business input from Uday
- RC fleet/billing API contracts need exploration before Phases 3-5
